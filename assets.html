				<h3> How to add in a fancy modal using fancybox </h3>
				<code> Note: there is a JS file for fancybox, a sass file and the init statement in the main js file that are necessary but dont need to be touched for adding modal items</code>
				<pre>
					// To start, create an 'a' tag wrapped around your item that will trigger modal on click
					// it will require a class of fancybox and an href with the id of the modal content
					&lt;a href="#modal-content-1" class="fancybox"&gt; CLICK this to see MODAL! &lt;/a&gt;

					// After creating your button, or wrapping content in the fancybox 'a' tag to enable the
					// modal, create a div with the ID you targeted with your href in the fancybox 'a' tag 
					// and a class of modal-window that applies the correct css to your modal
					&lt;div id="modal-content-1" class="modal-window"&gt;
						EVERYTHING YOU WANT INSIDE YOUR MODAL POPUP GOES IN HERE IN HTML FORM 
						&lt;div class="modal-title"&gt; TITLE &lt;/div&gt;
						&lt;div class="modal-text"&gt; DESCRIBE WHAT THIS MODAL IS ABOUT &lt;/div&gt;
						&lt;div class="modal-pic"&gt; &lt;img src="file/path.jpg" &gt; &lt;/div&gt;
					 &lt;/div&gt;

					 // Also note that the modal-window sass can be edited in the _cirro.sass file and is the 
					 // styling on the modal window. Right now it has display: none so its hidden until modal 
					 // is triggered. Another class can be used as well if desired, and is not connected to 
					 // modal js or anything so you can also have multiple classes for multiple modal 
					 // stylings. Just dont forget to display: none the content so thats its not shown on page

					 // Further, since .modal-window HTML is (and needs) display: none, it can be placed
					 // anywhere on the page. Currently all my modals on example page are located at the 
					 // bottom of the document all inside &lt;section class="modal-content"&gt; just for 
					 // organization
